This Quarto website has Python code in the `code.qmd` file and has a Jupyter notebook. The GitHub Action will render those for you but note that you need some a special **RAW** block at the top of your ipynb file. Without this, the Jupyter notebook won't render (code blocks won't be computed). It looks like this
```
---
title: Jupyter Notebook
execute:
  enabled: true
jupyter: python3
---
```
Also you will need to add any modules that your code needs to the `requirements.txt` file so they are installed by the GitHub Action.

## GitHub Set-up

* Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this content.  Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch).

* Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings > Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory.

* Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the  Settings > Pages page to find the url.
