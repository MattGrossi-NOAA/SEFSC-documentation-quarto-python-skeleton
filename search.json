    "text": "This is a template for a simple Quarto website that looks like a “book”. This is a common format for documentation. It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to theme.scss. The webpage will be on the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nThis Quarto website has Python code in the code.qmd file and has a Jupyter notebook. The GitHub Action will render those for you but note that you need some a special RAW block at the top of your ipynb file. Without this, the Jupyter notebook won’t render (code blocks won’t be computed). It looks like this\nAlso you will need to add any modules that your code needs to the requirements.txt file so they are installed by the GitHub Action.\nInstructions for using this theme can be found in the HOWTO: Using the SEFSC Quarto Theme pages."

This will be done using GitHub submodules for the reasons discussed earlier.\n\nStep 8: Creating submodules\nThese steps take place in the template repo.\n\nUsing a terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the home directory of the template repo.\nCreate a submodule for the navbar:\ngit submodule add --branch navbars --force --name navbars_theme https://github.com/&lt;GitHub-username&gt;/&lt;theme-repo&gt; navbars\nwhere &lt;GitHub-username&gt; is the owner of the GitHub repository &lt;theme-repo&gt;.\nCreate a submodule to import the theme itself:\ngit submodule add --force --name documentation-theme-quarto https://github.com/&lt;GitHub-username&gt;/&lt;theme-repo&gt; theme\n\nSteps 2 and 3 will create two new directories in the template repo: navbars and theme (the last argument in the command line calls).\n\nCommit the changes as usual, for example:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add navbar and theme files from theme repo\"\ngit push origin docs\nOn the template repo GitHub page, these new directories will show up with an appended commit ID (e.g., theme @ a1b2c3d). These commit IDs indicate the version of these two theme repo branches that are currently loaded into the template repo.\nIn the .github/workflows directory, edit the `render-and-publish.yml’ file as follows:\n\nChange the push branch from main to docs:\nname: Render and deploy quarto files\non:\n  push:\n    branches: docs\nAppend to the quarto-render-and-deploy checkout step as follows to checkout the submodules before rendering the project:\njobs:\n  quarto-render-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          submodules: recursive\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Finish the metadata files\n\nIn the template repo _quarto.yml:\n\nAppend the directory theme/ to the theme.scss and theme-dark.scss files so that Quarto knows where to find them:\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      light: [cosmo, theme/theme.scss] \n      dark: [cosmo, theme/theme-dark.scss]\nAdd the following block:\nmetadata-files:\n  - theme/_website.yml\n  - navbars/_topnav_sefsc.yml\n  - _metadata.yml\n\nCommit the changes.\nIn the theme repo _website.yml, append the directory theme/ to the favicon call so that Quarto knows where to find it:\nwebsite: \n  ...\n  favicon: theme/images/favicon.png\nCommit the changes.\n\nWith everything committed to GitHub, the template repo’s external website (the URL from Step 1.8) should render properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe repo is configured to use GitHub Actions to automatically render and publish to the gh-pages branch whenever new changes are pushed to the main branch. It does, however, take a short period of time for the various processes to run behind the scenes, so updates may not appear immediately. On the GitHub repo homepage, a brown dot will appear next to username and latest commit message after a change is pushed, indicating that the page is being rebuilt. This dot will become a green check mark once successfully finished. The website can be refreshed once that happens.",

To make this more suitable for code repositories, we will reserve the main branch for code and other project files and use a dedicated docs branch to host the Quarto website files.\n\nUsing a terminal or Command Prompt on your local computer, navigate to the new template repo directory.\nCreate a new docs branch and push to GitHub:\ngit checkout -b docs\ngit push origin docs\nClear out the main branch and return to docs:\n```bash git checkout main rm -r . git commit -m “Remove all files from branch” git push origin main git checkout docs\n\nFrom this point on, all template repo activity will refer to the docs branch unless otherwise noted.

    "text": "IOOS uses a custom website theme to maintain consistent formatting, appearance, and functionality across all documentation sites. Some of the most noticable thematic features include:\n\nIOOS header logo added and colors changed in accordance with branding guidelines\nPage footer with appropriate links and contact information\nCommon horizontal navigation bar with IOOS-related links and resources\n“Behind the scenes” configurations that govern how the website works\n\nThis theme is simply a GitHub repository containing the necessary configuration files, scripts, and visual branding to provide the underlying structure of a documentation web page. IOOS implements this theme in all documentation pages through the use of GitHub submodules, the details of which are beyond the scope of this document but, in short, allow theme files to be contained in their own repository and then embedded into a separate repository that contains the content files for the web page. There are several advantages to this. First, it means that individuals seeking to write documentation do not need to worry about creating a website. The “guts” already exist. Second, the same theme repository can be embedded into an infinite number of documentation repositories, providing a consistent look and feel across all of them. Finally, the theme can be modified at any time by the owner (for example, the IOOS Program Office) and those changes can easily be propagated through to every other site that uses the theme by simply pulling the changes into each of the respective repositories.\n\nStep 4: Create a new “documentation-theme-quarto” repository\nThis is done on the GitHub website and assumes the user already has a GitHub account and is signed in. These steps will duplicate the NOAA Open Science repo into that user’s account. This repo will contain the theme files and manage site appearances according to the needs of the SEFSC.\n\nOn the “Repositories” tab, click the green “New” button to create a new repo.\nDo not select a template. Select a repository ower, provide a name (e.g., “documentation-theme-quarto”), and type a description, if desired.\nClick “Create repository”. We will refer to this repo as the theme repo throughout these instructions.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Clone this repository locally\n\nOne the main page of the new repo, click the green “&lt; &gt; Code” button.\nCopy the HTTPS web URL shown in the popup.\nOn your local computer, in a terminal window or Command Prompt, navigate to where the theme repo is to be downloaded, and type\ngit clone &lt;URL&gt;\nwhere &lt;URL&gt; is the web URL from Step 4.2 above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis theme repo can be located in the same parent directory as the template repo created earlier, but it should not be located within that repo.\n\n\nPress enter. The repo will now be downloaded to your local machine.\nAlternatively, after Step 4.1, either use the “Open with GitHub Desktop” or the “Download ZIP” options shown above to download the repo. Be sure to unzip it if you retrieve it this way.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Populate the theme repository\n\nMove the following from the template repo to this new theme repo:\n\ntheme-dark.scss\ntheme.scss\nLICENSE\nimages (directory and content)\n\nIf using a terminal or Command Prompt (Git Bash is recommended on Windows):\nmv -r path/to/template-repo/filename path/to/theme-repo\nIf you are in the template repo directory, you can use:\nmv filename path/to/theme-repo\nOr, if you are in the theme repo directory:\nmv -r path/to/template-repo .\nCommit these changes to each repo. You can use the same commit message for each if you want, for example:\ngit add *\ngit commit -m \"Move theme files from template repo to theme repo\"\ngit push origin main\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis will have to be done separately in each repo.\n\n\n\nNow we have a theme repo, we can customize it for the SEFSC.",

    "text": "Step 7: Customize the theme\nThese steps take place primarily in the theme repo created on the previous page but also reference (and modify) the template repo created earlier.\nQuarto projects are configured using a _quarto.yml file; see the docs for more info. The new template repo contains this file already. The metadata sharing feature of Quarto allows that _quarto.yml file up to be split into multiple files. Quarto will combine them together again when the project is rendered. We will take advantage of this feature here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitting all changes at the end of each step below is strongly recommended, keeping in mind that some steps modify both the template and theme repos.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, create a new file in the theme repo called _website.yml and populate it with any website configuration settings from the template repo _quarto.yml that should be consistent across all documentation pages. These settings include:\n\nWebsite page navaigation\nRepo actions\nFormat settings\nFilter\n\nDelete the relevant lines from the template repo _quarto.yml and insert them into the theme repo _website.yml file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nFor any section that gets split up, be sure to replicate the section header in the new yaml file so that Quarto knows how to merge them. See the example that follows.\n\n\nFor example, the original template repo _quarto.yml file contains:\nwebsite: \n  page-navigation: true\n  title: \"NOAA quarto simple\" \n  site-url: \"https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-simple-python\" \n  repo-url: \"https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-quarto-simple-python\"\n  repo-actions: [edit, source, issue]\n  favicon: images/favicon.ico\nAfter completing this step, the new theme _website.yml file should contain:\nwebsite: \n  page-navigation: true\n  repo-actions: [edit, source, issue]\n  favicon: images/favicon.ico\nleaving the following in _quarto.yml:\n  website: \n    title: \"NOAA quarto simple\" \n    site-url: \"https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-simple-python\" \n    repo-url: \"https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-quarto-simple-python\"\nNote that both files contain a website: section header.\nTake this a step further by creating a second file, _metadata.yml, in the theme repo to contain the only site information that a user will need to set when creating a new documentation site. For now, the four website elements above (title, site-url, and repo-url) are the only elements that need to be set for each project (this is the beauty of using Quarto for this application!) Remove this section from the template _quarto.yml file and insert them into the new theme repo _metadata.yml file.\nAt this point, _quarto.yml should no longer contain a website section: it has been entirely distributed between _website.yml and _metadata.yml.\nBack in the theme repo _website.yml file:\n\nAdd and configure a page-footer to contain NOAA, Fisheries, and SEFSC contact information.\nConfigure the sidebar with NOAA and SEFSC information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSetting contents: auto allows the sidebar to be automatically generated, eliminating the need for manual construction or configuration. Users should therefore follow the instructions in the docs for facilitating this feature.\n\n\nIn the theme repo theme.scss and theme-dark.scss files, assign NOAA-specific colors to variable names for easy use later. These colors were taken from the NOAA Fisheries Brand Standards and include NOAA primary colors, grays, and secondary colors for each region. For example:\n// NOAA Fisheries Primary Palette\n$noaa-light-blue: #0093D0;\n$noaa-dark-blue: #0055A4;\n$navy-blue-pantone: #00467F;\nUpload a new favicon image to the images directory, if desired. If a different file name is used, modify _website.yml accordingly:\nwebsite:\n  ...\n  favicon: path/to/new-favicon.ico\nCreate a new branch on the theme repo called navbars to be used for the top navigation bar of the documentation site.\nCommand line:\ngit -b checkout navbars\nOr on the repo’s GitHub website (be sure to run git fetch locally to retreive it)\nCreate a new file on this branch, _topnav_sefsc.yml.\nAdd and configure a navbar for the website containing relevant resources and links. For example:\nwebsite:\nnavbar:\n   background: $navy-blue-pantone\n   search: true\n   right:\n     - text: \"SEFSC Resources\"\n       menu:\n         - href: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/southeast-fisheries-science-center\n           text: SEFSC Homepage\n         - href: https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/\n           text: NOAA Fisheries Open Science\n     - text: \"Software & Documentation\"\n       menu:\n         - href: https://github.com/sefsc\n           text: SEFSC GitHub Organization\n         - href: https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/\n           text: NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox\nCommit the changes to this branch, for example:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit push origin navbars\n\nNext we will tie all of this together.",

    "text": "Quarto is used widely across NOAA Fisheries because of its flexibility, alignment with open science principles, integration with the R programming language and RStudio, and its relative ease of use. A number of use cases, including several webpages, are demonstrated on the NMFS Open Science GitHub page. While most NOAA Fisheries staff use Quarto with R and RStudio, Quarto also supports Python, Jupyter, and Visual Studio (VS) Code, all of which are more common within the computer science and, in particular, the artifiicial intelligence and machine learning communities. One of the most compelling features of Quarto is its seamless integration with GitHub for version control and hosting websites.\nThe decision to use GitHub Pages (gh-pages) for SEFSC documentation was inspired by its widespread use within IOOS. Correspondence with an IOOS data management analyst revealed that all IOOS documentation pages are either already utilizing gh-pages or are in the process of migrating to it because of the strengths listed in Table 1. IOOS hosts a Documentation Portal within their organizational GitHub account to compile all products and projects documentation in one central location.\nAn existing NMFS Open Science template for a simple Quarto web book with Python support provided the starting point (see the repository’s acknowledgements for full credit.) This repository (repo) contains both website configuration files, such as yaml files and images, and content files in the form of Quarto Markdown files. It was pre-configured to build and deploy the web book (i.e., webpage) to a gh-pages branch while the configuration and content files resided in the main branch. More on this later. The steps taken to replicate and adapt this for SEFSC documentation pages follow.",

    "text": "This page is for informational purposes only. It’s technical. It captures the process to create the GitHub Pages SEFSC-documentation-quarto-python-skeleton repository template for use within the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center. Nothing herein needs to be repeated to create a specific documentation page in a GitHub repository. These steps are only necessary if one desires to create a new template of the same format and functionality – for example, if a different Financial Management Center (FMC) desires to create their own custom template. Instructions for creating an actual documentation page using the theme are provided in Getting started with SEFSC Quarto Documentation Theme Skeleton.\nThe NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) is actively developing a suite of new, innovative machine learning models designed to increase data processing efficiencies across the Center’s mission portfolio. These projects include, but are not limited to, automating the processing of Gulf and South Atlantic video survey data to derive species counts, automating aging of Gulf and Atlantic menhaden and red snapper, and automating the derivation of fish lengths from stereo video. These models were developed in Python using open-source libraries (e.g., PyTorch, cudatoolkit, Torchvision, and scikit-learn) by partners through the NOAA Northern Gulf Institute (NGI) and the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) and are or will be maintained on the SEFSC Organization GitHub account.\nIntroducing new computer models into the Center’s data processing procedures necessitates adequate documentation so that the end users will know how to install and execute the models in operational use. Indeed, all computer models and software should be documented by the developers before being released to the intended end user. In the absence of a universally accepted documentation template for use within the SEFSC, NOAA Fisheries, or even NOAA at large, staff across NOAA have established their own approaches and templates of varying degrees of complexity based on their immediate needs. Some examples of these solutions are summarized in Table 1 along with notable strengths and weaknesses of each.\nSeveral features were prioritized when selecting a platform for SEFSC documentation:\n\nContent version control\nDocumentation existing alongside the model source code\nMinimal learning curve for populating and maintaining content\nLayout and formatting customization to align with agency visual branding requirements\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: A variety of resources have been used across NOAA for documenting procedures or applications, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. In the absence of guidance or directives, users currently select the approach best suited to their needs. This non-exhaustive list provides some examples of documentation solutions.\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION SOLUTION\n\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n\nDISADVANTAGES\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Word or Google Doc\n\n\n\n\nCreation is straightforward\n\n\nEasily converted to PDF\n\n\nSoftware readily available to NOAA staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot co-located with software\n\n\nDocument owner often retains ownership\n\n\nDifficult to share publicly\n\n\nNo version control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub respository Wiki  Example: NOAA IOOS National Glider Data Assembly Center (NGDAC) Documentation (archived)\n\n\n\n\nConsistent formatting across all GitHub repositories (repos)\n\n\nConnected to the repo in which application is hosted\n\n\nPublic accessibility follows repo settings\n\n\nNo local software requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited functionality\n\n\nNo ability to customize appearances, layouts, etc.\n\n\nLimited version control\n\n\nLearning curve with Markdown and HTML to populate content\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto webpage made with R  Example: Quarto webpage with book layout made in RStudio\n\n\n\n\nConsistent formatting across implementations\n\n\nHosted on GitHub Pages (gh-pages) alongside the software itself\n\n\nGitHub version controlled\n\n\nTemplate and setup guidance available via NOAA Fisheries Open Science initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning curve with Markdown and HTML to populate content\n\n\nLearning curve with R and RStudio to develop content locally\n\n\nLearning curve with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions if customization is needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto webpage made with Python  Example: Quarto webpage with book layout made with Python\n\n\n\n\nConsistent formatting across implementations\n\n\nCan be customized for the organization with optional centralized format control\n\n\nEasily templated to minimize learning curves\n\n\nHosted on gh-pages within the repo in which the application is hosted\n\n\nFull GitHub version control\n\n\nTemplate and setup guidance available via NOAA Fisheries Open Science initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning curve with Markdown and HTML (optional) to populate content\n\n\nLearning curve with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions if customization is needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Pages webpage with Jekyll theme  Example: NOAA IOOS Documentation Portal\n\n\n\n\nConsistent formatting across implementations\n\n\nCan be customized for the organization with optional centralized format control\n\n\nEasily templated to minimize learning curves\n\n\nHosted on gh-pages within the repo in which the application is hosted\n\n\nFull GitHub version control\n\n\nTemplate and setup guidance created by IOOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning curve with Markdown and HTML to populate content\n\n\nAdvanced customization requires knowledge of gh-pages, GitHub Actions, CSS, and other languages\n\n\nInitial setup can be challenging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Docs, though straightforward to create and widely used across NOAA, present too many challenges. File ownership is a perpetual problem, with the original author often retaining ownership and files getting lost in staffing changes. Without preserving documents’ URLs, sharing access permissions, and transferring ownership when needed, these files often get lost or are not known to exist by new staff. There is also a tendency for documents to perpetually stay in “draft” version, which casts doubt on the accuracy of the content and whether or not a final version exists. A far better solution is one that is connected to GitHub where the model code itself is hosted and maintained. One option is GitHub Wikis, which can be created for any repository and have been widely used by NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) programs, such as the original National Glider Data Assembly Center documentation page. Yet these Wikis offer limited version control and customization aside from the actual content. GitHub Pages, a service that allows a project website to be freely hosted for any repository, offers a more comprehensive assortment of options and flexibilities including customizable themes that can be tailored to agency visual branding, the ability to control this theme in one repository and use it across any number of documents, full version control, and the option of creating a template repository that can be easily duplicated and integrated into new projects. This project uses the simplicity of Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system, to create a documentation website and utilizes GitHub Pages for hosting with full version control.

    "text": "This page walked through the creation of two new GitHub repositories: a documentation skeleton template repository using Quarto, which can be duplicated and populated with headers and text to create document a model, source code, or any other project; and a second theme repository that contains the behind-the-scenes configurations, branding, etc. to control the look and functionality of the site. These two repositories were linked together using GitHub submodules allowing the theme repo to be managed separately from all documentation repos while ensuring that all documentation repos share the same look and feel. This is particularly important for adhering to organizational branding requirements.\nSeparating the website theme files from the content repository also minimizes the learning curve to creating a new site because there is no need to re-create or configure any back-end settings. This means there is no need to know or learn HTML, JavaScript, or any other languages used to generate the site itself. And by templating the Markdown files containing the actual content of the documentation site, next to no knowledge of Markdown is needed either: the user can essentially replace the placeholder text with the appropriate narrative. Instructions on how to proceed in creating a new repo using the template are contained in the HowTo pages. This template can also be easily added to an existing repo containing, for example, source code, allowing the documentation to live in a docs branch alongside the code itself in the main. Importantly, because all of this is done in GitHub, every component is completely version controlled.\nWe hope this page provides guidance for others within NOAA interested in creating their own Quarto website template. These can either be forked from NMNFS Open Science directly, as the steps describe, or from the SEFSC repos created herein. The latter may be particularly beneficial for other FMCs within NOAA Fisheries, as this SEFSC template may be closer to what such a user would want.",
